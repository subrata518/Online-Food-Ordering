# Online-Food-Ordering
Online Food Ordering (Frontend Only) is a responsive web-based interface that simulates an online food ordering system. Users can browse menus, view food items, add items to their cart, and proceed to a mock checkout page. This project is focused purely on the UI/UX design and frontend functionality.
